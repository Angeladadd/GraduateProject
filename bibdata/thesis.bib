abstract="A value-passing calculus is a process calculus in which the contents of communications are values chosen from some data domain, and the propositions appearing in the conditionals are formulas constructed from a logic. Previous studies treat the domain models, as well as the logic theories, as unspecified oracles. The open-ended approach leaves open some fundamental issues unanswered. The paper provides a more formal account of the value-passing calculi. The new treatment is self-contained in that the logic theory a value-passing calculus refers to is formally defined. A value-passing calculus consists of a complete first order theory with an operational model that makes use of the terms and the boolean expressions of the theory. A systematic investigation into the theory of the value-passing calculi is carried out. A particular value-passing calculus, {\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}VPC{\}}{\$}, is shown to be the least expressive among all Turing complete value-passing calculi.",

In this paper we treat this problem in the setting of process algebra in the form of ACP. First, probabilities are introduced by an operator for the internal probabilistic choice. In this way we obtain the Basic Process Algebra with probabilistic choice prBPA. After-wards, prBPA is extended with parallel composition to ACP$\pi$+. We give the axiom system for ACP$\pi$+and a complete operational semantics that preserves the interleaving model for the dynamic concurrent processes. Considering the PAR protocol, a communication protocol that can be used in the case of unreliable channels, we investigate the applicability of ACP$\pi$+. Using in addition only the priority operator and the preabstraction operator we obtain a recursive specification of the behaviour of the protocol that can be viewed as a Markov chain.",

In particular, we define the notion of branching bisimilarity and study its properties by studying two other equivalence relations, viz.coloured trace equivalence and branching bisimilarity using maximal probabilities. We show that both alternatives coincide with branching bisimilarity. The alternative characterisations have their own merits and focus on different aspects of branching bisimilarity. Coloured trace equivalence can be understood without knowledge of probability theory and is independent of the notion of a scheduler. Branching bisimilarity, rephrased in terms of maximal probabilities gives rise to an algorithm of polynomial complexity for deciding the equivalence. Together they give a better understanding of branching bisimilarity. Furthermore, we show that the notions of branching bisimilarity in the alternating model of Hansson and in the non-alternating model of Segala differ: branching bisimilarity in the latter setting turns out to discriminate between systems that are intuitively branching bisimilar."

abstract="This paper compares two models of concurrency, Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and the failures model of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) developed by Hoare, Brookes and Roscoe. By adapting Milner's synchronisation trees to serve as notation for both CCS and CSP, we are able to define a representation mapping for CSP processes. We define an equivalence relation on synchronisation trees which corresponds precisely to the notion of failure equivalence. Milner's calculus is founded on a different notion, observation equivalence. We show how these two equivalences are related. Just as Milner's equivalence can be characterised as the smallest relation satisfying a set of axioms, we find a suitable set of axioms for the failures equivalence relation. This again makes explicit the differences between the two systems, as well as revealing that the semantic models underlying CCS and CSP are comparable.",

The so-called bathtub curve of failure rates is applied for the reliability of electronic systems; understanding the middle of this curve, which represents a constant failure rate, is critical in practice. The reliability parameters for electronic systems are easily calculated by applying this constant failure rate (Sect. 4.3). The failure modes of electronic components are described in Sect. 4.4. We show how the required reliability parameters for individual components and modules can be determined by applying the mode of constant failure rate (Sects. 4.5 and 4.6). In addition, we present how the system reliability can be calculated from the reliability of individual components. Finally, Sect. 4.7 contains recommendations for upgrading the reliability of electronic systems.",

Using symbolic actions we generalise the standard notion of labelled transition graph to that of symbolic transition graph. The advantage of the latter is that the operational semantics of many value-passing processes may be expressed in terms of finite symbolic transition graphs although the underlying (standard) labelled transitions graph is infinite. A collection of symbolic bisimulations parameterised on boolean expressions, âb, are then defined over symbolic transition graphs. These are related to standard bisimulations by proving that t âb u if and only if in every interpretation which satisfies b, t is bisimulation equivalent to u in the standard sense. We then give an algorithm for checking the relation t âb u which can be applied to arbitrary finite symbolic trees. The results apply to both early and late bisimulation equivalence, which are the two natural generalisations of the standard bisimulation equivalence to value-passing languages."
