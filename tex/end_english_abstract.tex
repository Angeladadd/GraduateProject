  With the rapid development of parrallel and distributed computer system,
  concurrency theory plays a key role in the theory of programs.
  Randomization is also am important part in Computer Science since it is a computational property. 
  Recently, Fu proposed a uniform approach
  used to turn a process model into a randomized extension.
  Since it is a model independent approach,
  we can use it to derive a probabilistic extension of 
  any other process model.
